GitHub Codeowners Browser Extension

## Features

- Decorate each file header with labels showing the owners who must approve that file
- Owner labels of teams that you're a member of are shown in red and have a star (★)
- Owner labels of teams that have already approved are shown in green and have a checkmark (✓)
  - The star becomes lighter in your own teams (☆)
- Hovering on an owner label shows a tooltip with the members of that team
- Clicking an owner label expands all the files with that owner, and collapses the others
