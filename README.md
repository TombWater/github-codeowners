GitHub Codeowners Chrome Extension

## Features

- Decorate each file header with labels showing the owners who must approve that file
- Owner labels that the reviewer can approve have the severe color and a star (★)
- Owner labels that are already approved have the success color and a checkmark (✓)
  - For the user's own teams the star becomes hollow (☆)
- Clicking an owner label expands all the files with that owner, and collapses the others

## Install

If your repo needs a GitHub token to access it, paste it in the extension's popup UI by clicking on its icon.
