## Features

Decorate PR file headers with labels showing the owners who must approve that file

- Owner labels of teams that you're a member of are shown in red and have a star (★)
- Owner labels of teams that have already approved are shown in green and have a checkmark (✓)
- The star becomes lighter in your own teams that have approved (☆)
- Hovering on an owner label shows a drawer with the members of that team
- Clicking an owner label highlights that owner label in all file headers
